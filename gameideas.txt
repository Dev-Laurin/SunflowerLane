Ideas: 

Have long-term goals like milking machine & automation of cheese/products/animal care (workers)

Use minigames (have to complete like Lost in Blue) to get these once you have the materials and money
	-like soldering wires

Have meaningful relationships with all townsfolk (with cutscenes)

Have heart near portraits of romance

Start really poor (no shoes?) Homeless in city, rainy, walk until there are green fields, plant your first seed 


Have a rival farmer (maybe someone who comes to town just like you at the same time? Someone who was rude before you got there?) Or have the person already there. 

DO like the musical notes -> get achievements for certain activities (cooking, friendships, staying up late, getting exhausted)

friends with animals? Stray/wild ones?
